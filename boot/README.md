#### Things
A "short" jump is a relative jump to a particular offset.
A long jump uses a larger offset value and can jump further.
Short and Long jumps are both relative. In assembly, they are 
automatically done by the compiler. Far jump specifies both 
a segment and offset. This is an absolute address not an 
offset.
